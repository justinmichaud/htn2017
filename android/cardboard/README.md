Cardboard Java
=====================
Copyright (c) 2014 Google Inc.  All rights reserved.

Decompiled CardboardSDK 0.5.1.

The *TreasureHunt* sample project, running fully from source. It compiles and runs on Android Studio 1.0.2. The Cardboard.jar package has been replaced by the decompiled sources. Decompiled using [Luyten](https://github.com/deathmarine/Luyten).

Inspiration from [raasun's cardboard](https://github.com/raasun/cardboard) (decompilation of an older version of CardboardSDK). According to *raasun*, Google should eventually release the official CardboardSDK source.
